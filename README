= Description
  A Ruby module that can make your classes final. A final class cannot
  be subclassed, and its instance methods cannot be redefined.

= Synopsis
  require 'final'

  class Alpha
    include Final

    def foo
      puts "Hello"
    end
  end

  # Error! You cannot subclass Alpha.
  class Beta < Alpha; end

  # Error! You cannot redefine an existing method.
  class Alpha
    def foo
      puts "Hi"
    end
  end

  # Not an error. You can add new methods to an existing class.
  class Alpha
    def bar
      puts "World"
    end
  end

= Developer's Notes
  This library is merely a proof of concept that was published as the result
  of a tweet made by James Edward Gray II, where he commented that Ruby core
  classes should never be subclassed. Knowing that static languages like Java
  implement the "final" keyword as a way to prevent subclassing, I wanted to
  see if something similar could be done for Ruby. Turns out it can.

  I do not, however, necessarily advocate actually using this library in
  production code. Freezing a class this way is contrary to the very nature
  of Ruby and dynamic languages in general. If you're going to use it, you had
  better have a very good reason for doing so!

= Caveats
  Only instance methods are prevented from redefinition. Singleton methods are
  not final. This change may happen in a future release.
